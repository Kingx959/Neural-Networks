# Neural-Networks
 Contains a CNN using the MNIST dataset to create machine learning model that can read hand written digits.
 Also contains a Neural Network working with a cancer dataset to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant on new and unseen data.

 new additions to the NN rep:
 CNN used to identify images. was trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset consisnting 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class.

 Lip-reading Neural Network. trained on the GRID dataset that consisnts of videos and associated alignments.
